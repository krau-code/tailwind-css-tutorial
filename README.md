## Tailwind CSS Tutorial

Tailwind Crash Course by **Traversy Media**

This is a duplicate website of what Brad did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand tailwindcss more.

Some things that I added/changed:
* Changed the testimonial section **from** *hiding the two testimony cards in small devices* **to** *displaying them all in column in small devices*
* Added a horizontal space between testimony cards in small devices
* Changed the responsiveness of links in footer for medium devices
* Added a favicon
